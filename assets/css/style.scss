/*
enable sticky H2 headers that keep at the top of the windows when scrolling,
but only if the screen is at least 500px wide as headings might otherwise wrap
to two lines and might cause ugly overlapping effects.

For headings that wrap even with 500px layout, add the class 'long' to them
to avoid the stickiness:

    {: .long}
    ## This is a very long title that would wrap even with 500 px width

*/

        position: sticky;

        background: #f2f2f2;
